# nlp-models
These are my reimplementations of various NLP models using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)+[torchtext](https://github.com/pytorch/text). Not all of them have been trained.

## Embeddings

- Pennington, et al., 2014. "GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation". ([source code](embeddings/glove.ipynb))

## Language Models
- Bengio, et al., 2003. "A Neural Probablistic Language Model". ([source code](language_models/bengio_2003.ipynb))

## Translation
- Sutskever, et al., 2014. "Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks". ([source code](translation/seq2seq.ipynb))
