# nlp-models
These are my quick implementations of various NLP models using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), mostly for didactic purposes and for easier copy-pasting into bigger projects.

## Embeddings

- Pennington, et al., 2014. "GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation". ([source code](embeddings/glove.py))

## Language Models
- Bengio, et al., 2003. "A Neural Probablistic Language Model". ([source code](language_models/bengio_2003.py))

## Translation
- Sutskever, et al., 2014. "Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks". ([source code](translation/seq2seq.py))
- Bahdanau, et al., 2014. "Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate". ([source code](translation/seq2seq_attention.py))
